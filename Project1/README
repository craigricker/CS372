## Building Server
In command line type "make server" this will simply give execute access to server

## Running server
To run the server, simply type "./chatserve <PORT#>".
Ensure that port# is currently open and available. 
If not, program will fail and you will have to rerun from the command line.

The script will prompt the user to enter a username, and then wait for a user to connect.
Once the user connects, they will alternate sending messages back and forth.
When either user types \quit, the connection will close, and the client will exit.
The server will remain openly running, and begin waiting for a new connection.

## Building client
Within the active directory, type "make client"

## Running client
It is *very* important the server is running before the client.
In the command prompt, type  "./chatclient <SERVER-HOSTNAME> <PORT#>"
Replacing information within <> with valid host name and port
The client will then prompt the user to enter  a screen name, and then prompt for a first message.

Once the user connects, they will alternate sending messages back and forth.
When either user types \quit, the connection will close, and the client will exit.


## Extra Credit
I added proper SIGINT handling to the py server

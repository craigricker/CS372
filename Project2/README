It is best if ftserver.c and ftclient.py are running in seperate directories.
However, unique file descripters can and will be added if running from the same directory.

This program was tested on flip1 and flip 2.

To compile all the programs type "make all". This will do the following:
- compile ftserver
- add executable permissions to ftserver and ftclient.py

To start the server, type the following in the command line:
./ftserver [PORT_NUMBER] 
Where port number is a valid port number
In a seperate window, to start the client type one of the two following commands:
To see the list of files:
python3 ftclient.py [SERVER_HOST (flip1-3)] [ftserver PORT_NUMBER] -l [DATA_PORT]
To download a specific file from the directory
python3 ftclient.py [SERVER_HOST (flip1-3)] [ftserver PORT_NUMBER] -g [FILE_NAME] [DATA_PORT]
